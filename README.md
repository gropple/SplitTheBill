# Split The Bill
This Android app lets you easily split a restaurant bill fairly.  It's [released on the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.splitthebill&hl=en).

# Background
The app was a successful hobby project attempt to see if I could write and publish an Android app in Scala in a few days.  

# Features
Split The Bill is a tip calculator and restaurant meal bill splitter. It takes seconds to calculate a tip and split the bill fairly.

* Split the bill unevenly. If your meal was smaller, you should pay less.

* Simple tip calculator - add a percentage or amount to the bill. The app splits that tip fairly, along with any tax and included tip, based on how much each person ate.

* It's easy to input your meal, just enter "4.99 + 6.50 + 3.65". No more calculators at the table, and no need to enter each item one-by-one.

* It's easy and fast. Those that don't enter amounts will have whatever's left on the bill split between them. So you can also use the app as a simple free tip calculator and equal bill splitter.

* Optional change splitter and calculator - tell it what you paid and the app tells you what change you should take.

* Optional who owes who calculator - tell it what change you took, and the app calculates who owes who. You can then share that as a reminder with your friends via email, text message, Whatsapp and Facebook (and others).

* Currency agnostic - works for any currency in the world.
